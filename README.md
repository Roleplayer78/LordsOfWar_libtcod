The Lords Of War
================

A rougue-like RPG set in a historical inspired medieval Europe.


Incipit
=======

There are a lot rouge-like RPGs that can be described as dungeons crawlers while, nearly all are fantasy.
LoW wants to be different.

It wants to connect the medieval ages with the fascinating world of the ascii RPGs creating an exapansive,
breathing world.

Some of the main points of the game:
# A complete Europe map, rendered in ascii of course, with different kingdoms
# A free, open world, to explore
# Capitol and major cities created while villages and hamlet procedurally created but then saved
# A involved character generation and advancement, based on real-world skills and capabilities
# Realistic combat that made out with HP and tracks wounds individually
# Tactical choices like attacks, defences, counter-attacks all based on medieval treaties
# Saints, religions and alchemy directly taken by history, but with a twist
# World-based objects
# A complex and involved storyline spanning Europe
# Who knows....
