Some of the main points of the game:

* Saints, religions and alchemy directly taken by history, but with a twist
* World-based objects, with desctructable environment
* Day/Night cycle and wether that will affect gameplay
* Portraits while engaged in conversations
* Multi-character party and possibly a warband
